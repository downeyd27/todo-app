## Synopsis

This app will allow you to keep track of different todo items(tasks).  You have the capability of crossing out tasks as you complete them and trashing them when you want them completely from your list.  This application has the ability to create multiple lists so you can stay more organized.  Of course there is the functionality of being able to edit mistakes if you made a boo boo.

## Motivation

I built this app to practice creating a CRUD style app with RESTful routing in a Ruby on Rails framework.
